## About

---

Iâ€™m a former doctor who has discovered a new passion in the world of technology.
My journey into the tech field has been self-guided and self-motivated, having leveraged various online platforms to master the fundamentals of Computer Science.

My love for problem solving led me to specialize in **Python Backend Engineering**, which I studied at Yandex Practicum.
Further enriching my tech skills, I pursued a Skills Bootcamp at Just IT, where I gained invaluable hands-on experience with a broad array of backend technologies.

With a unique blend of a scientific background and solid technical expertise, I am now looking to bring my problem-solving mindset and programming abilities to a team in the tech industry.
Specifically, I am currently seeking a **junior role or apprenticeship in backend development**.

I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting and contribute towards building innovative tech solutions.
